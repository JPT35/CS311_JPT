                        For this project I had experience using the tailwind framework and its library in the past,
                        so I found the work to be familiar and easy to set up.  My main issues were struggling with my tailwind.config file
                        which wasn't properly set up to my html pages when I started.

                        I also had some struggles early on with confusion around the input and output css files, but after running 
                        npm build -css a few times, I was able to figure out the configuration.
